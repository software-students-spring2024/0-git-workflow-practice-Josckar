## The Specific
The article describes the multifaceted world of software engineering, illustrating how it includes coding, but is in general an approach to the design, testing, and maintenance of software. It's interesting to see how the field evolved from early problems with hardware synchronization to becoming a recognized engineering field (particularly the Apollo missions playing a role was interesting). It also provides important information about the development of the field, showcasing how the expansion of the field changed its nature and the opportunities that come with it.

The also article describes the legal aspects surrounding software engineering. The absence of formal licensing requirements in some regions like the UK as compared to the accreditation processes in Canada and the United States were interesting. The global legal differences are ironic when taking into consideration the globalized nature of the field.
